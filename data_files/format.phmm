# I - Length of sequence 1
#01255555555555555555555555555 J - Length of sequence 2
# Qi - the probability of opening an insertion gap
# Qd - the probability of opening a deletion gap
# Qg - gap continuation penalty (probability of staying in a deletion/insertion)
# Qbase (N values) - confidence score for each base
# One row of 3 initial state probabilites (Match, I-Insertion, J-Insertion)
# Final two lines are DNA sequences
